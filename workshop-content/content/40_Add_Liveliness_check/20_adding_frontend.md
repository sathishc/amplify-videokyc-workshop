We will now create a front end for the liveness feature to capture the portrait of the user. For ths we add a new Liveliness component to our recat app which includes a webcan integration. We will use the react-webcam component for this purpose. The liveness checks uses AWS Rekognition detect faces functionality to check of facial gestures like smile, open mouth and closed eyes. We use the Rekognition sdk in Amplify by enabling the Predictions feature with appropriate inputs.

1. **➡️ Run** `npm install --save 'react-webcam'` to add the webcam component.

2. **➡️ Run** `npm install --save 'lodash'` as we use this library for data structures
