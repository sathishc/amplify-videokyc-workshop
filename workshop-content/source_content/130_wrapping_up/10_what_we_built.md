While no application is really ever done, we've certainly come a long way toward building a shareable photo albums web app! 

Here's a reminder of everything we accomplished. We:

- Started with a simple React web app

- Added user authentication with a complete sign up and sign in flow

- Added Liveliness Check feature using Amazon Rekognition

- Added a photo ID document check feature using Amazon Rekognition and Comprehend

- Added a face comparison feature using Amazon Rekognition


- Built a production-ready version of the app and deployed it to the amplify console

The backend for our self services KYC app is entirely serverless, which means it's extremely cost efficient, scalable, and highly available thanks to services from AWS. 

Not bad for a few hours of work! 

Please give yourself a **huge pat on the back** for making it all the way to the end!
