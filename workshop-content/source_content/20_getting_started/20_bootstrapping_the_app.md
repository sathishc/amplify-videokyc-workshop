### Creating a React app
We'll get things started by building a new React web app using the **create-react-app** CLI tool. 

{{% notice info %}}
This will give us a sample React app with a local auto-reloading web server and some helpful transpiling support for the browser like letting us use async/await keywords, arrow functions, and more.

**➡️ In the Cloud9 terminal, run** `npx create-react-app video-kyc`.

**➡️ Then, navigate to the newly created directory with** `cd video-kyc`.


### Adding React Bootstrap

Before we start writing our UI, we'll also include React Bootstrap UI components for React to give us components that will help make our interface look a bit nicer.

**➡️ In the video-kyc directory, run** `npm install --save react-bootstrap`

**➡️ Replace `public/index.html` with** ___CLIPBOARD_BUTTON 0ce4b3e780ae9cbb429b4d2a6ac625a057a5fed5:video-kyc/public/index.html|

### Starting the App
Now let's start our development server so we can make changes and see them refreshed live in the browser.

**➡️ In the video-kyc directory, run** `npm start`. 

Once the web server has started, click the **Preview** menu and **select Preview Running Application**

If you'd like, you can also **pop the preview to a new window**:

Finally, **open another terminal window**. We'll leave this first terminal alone since it's running the web server process.

### Simplifying markup

Next, we'll want to start with a clean slate.

**➡️ Replace `src/App.js` with** ___CLIPBOARD_BUTTON 6c0bff7c33c87c1117890501a772279cf876fb41:video-kyc/src/App.js|

At this point, the browser should automatically refresh and show a much simpler page, with just some text that says 'Hello World'. It's not much to look at yet, but it's good to start with as little markup as possible.
