Now that we have our backend set up for managing registrations and sign-in, all we need to do is use the _withAuthenticator_ [higher-order React component from AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/media/authentication_guide.html#using-components-in-react) to wrap our existing _App_ component. This will take care of rendering a simple UI for letting users sign up, confirm their account, sign in, sign out, or reset their password.

### Adding Amplify NPM dependencies

We haven't yet added the *aws-amplify* and *aws-amplify-react* modules to our app, so let's add them.

**➡️ Run** `npm install --save aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react`

**➡️ Replace `src/App.js` with** ___CLIPBOARD_BUTTON 83f54c0769f7d11fbbb29e43cf451a8cd4257b04:video-kyc/src/App.js|

Take a look at the web app now and you should have a sign-up / sign-in form!

### What we changed in App.js

- Imported and configured the AWS Amplify JS library

- Imported the withAuthenticator higher order component from aws-amplify-react

- Wrapped the App component using withAuthenticator

### Creating an account

**➡️ Create an account in the app's web interface** by providing a username, password, and a **valid email address** (to receive a confirmation code at).

You'll be taken to a screen asking you to confirm a code. This is because Amazon Cognito wants to verify a user's email address before it lets them sign in.

**➡️ Check your email**. You should have received a confirmation code message. **Copy and paste the confirmation code** into your app and you should then be able to log in with the username and password you entered during sign up. 


{{% notice tip %}}
This is a pretty simple authentication UI, but there's a lot you can do to customize it, including replacing parts with your own React components or using a completely hosted UI that can redirect back to your app. See the Customization section of the [AWS Amplify Authentication Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/authentication_guide#customization) for more information.
